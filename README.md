# NumericalDaemons
This repository contains the data required to reproduce the results that are shown in the "Numerical daemons in Monte Carlo estimators of Bayesian model evidence." The file "random_errors_2D_linear_model.csv" contains the random errors `e` required to reproduce the results of the 2D linear mode (Eq. 21) that is `y=2x+3+e` such that `x={1,...,20}`. The model and data are adopted from Lu et al. (2012). <br>
