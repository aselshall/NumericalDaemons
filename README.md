# NumericalDaemons
This repository contains the data required to reproduce the results that are shown in the "Numerical daemons in Monte Carlo estimators of Bayesian model evidence." The file "data_2D_linear_model.csv" contains the data, which are the x and y values, required to reproduce the results of the 2D linear model `y=2x+3+e`.
